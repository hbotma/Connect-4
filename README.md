# Connect-4

Connect-4 coded in C++ using SFML

To run the code, you can download the .exe <NOT RECOMMENDED> and andlso.ttf, put them in the same directory, then run the .exe.

Although I highly recommend against downloading a .exe from some stranger. It's only a good idea if you just wanna see the game, yolo. It's safer to compile yourself, though.

If you would like to compile the code, you need SFML. Go to http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/ and pick your IDE under "Getting Started" then follow the instructions.
